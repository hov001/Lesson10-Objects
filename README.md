- Upvotes and downvotes

  - Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.

    ```
     getVoteCount({ upvotes: 13, downvotes: 0 }); // ➞ 13
    ```

- 50, 30, 20
  - The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on needs, 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.
  - Given the after-tax income as ati, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.
  ```
  fiftyThirtyTwenty(10000); // ➞ { "Needs": 5000, "Wants": 3000, "Savings": 2000 }
  fiftyThirtyTwenty(50000); // ➞ { "Needs": 25000, "Wants": 15000, "Savings": 10000 }
  fiftyThirtyTwenty(13450); // ➞ { "Needs": 6725, "Wants": 4035, "Savings": 2690 }
  ```

- Create a one-liner function

  - Create a function that takes an object as an argument and returns a string with facts about the city. The city facts will need to be extracted from the object's three properties:

  ```
  name
  population
  continent
  ```

  - The string should have the following format: X has a population of Y and is situated in Z.(where X is the city name, Y is the population and Z is the continent the city is situated in).

  ```
  cityFacts({
  name: "Paris",
  population: "2,140,526",
  continent: "Europe",
  }); // ➞ "Paris has a population of 2,140,526 and is situated in Europe"
  ```

- Create a function that takes infinite count of elements, operator and prints their sum. If there's no operator, then default should be +

```
printSum("*", 1, 2, 3); // 9
printSum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // 15
printSum("-", 1, 2, 3, 6, 7); // -17
printSum("**", 2, 3, 2); // 64
```

- Lowercase and Uppercase
  Write a function that creates an object with each (key, value) pair being the (lower case, upper case) versions of a letter, respectively.

```
mapping(["p", "s"]) ➞ { "p": "P", "s": "S" }
mapping(["a", "b", "c"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "b": "B", "c": "C" }
mapping(["a", "v", "y", "z"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "v": "V", "y": "Y", "z": "Z" }
```
